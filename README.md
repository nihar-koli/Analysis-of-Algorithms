# Analysis-of-Algorithms

These are the implementation of the few algorithms that I learned...

1. Dijkstra's algorithm -> To find shortest path between two nodes of graph.
2. Fractional Knapsack algorithm -> In this we can break items for maximizing the total value of knapsack(sack capacity).
3. Kruskal's algorithm ->  It is a greedy algorithm in graph theory as it finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected weighted graph.
4. NQueens algorithm -> It is Backtracking Algorithm where we place a queen in a column & we check for clashes with already placed queens.
5. Graph coloring -> Graph coloring problem is to assign colors to certain elements of a graph subject to certain constraints.

I learned this algorithms and programed them in C language.
Note:- All the programs are made to run on Turbo CPP compiler.
